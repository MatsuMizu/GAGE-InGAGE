# GAGE-InGAGE
This repository includes some Verilog descriptions of hardware implementations of elements of GAGE-InGAGE cypher. Read more about it at http://gageingage.org/

To run these testers you may install Icarus Verilog simulator. It's guide provides all the required instructions, but still:
Run this program in your console (in cmd as you run all other programs with console input).

Using cmd go to the directory with Makefile, type 'iverilog -o ./a.out Ler_tester.v' command (or any other *_tester.v).
Type 'vvp ./a.out' to see the results.

In fact the only purpose of these testers is to show that the schemes work properly (the are correct results in the output files).
